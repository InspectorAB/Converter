This is currently in progress for converting HTML to Word Doc.

Here I have tried below scenarios and their results:
1. HTML Template Raw to Word Doc -> Success
2. HTML Template With Inline Styling to Word Doc -> Success
3. HTML Template with Table Without Styling to Word Doc -> Success
4. HTML Template with Table with styling to Word Doc -> I haven't tried yet but I believe it will sucess!
5. HTML Tempalte with graph with/without styling to Word Doc -> Still in progress, dont open the word doc with graph in name its empty!


If any more scenarios comes to my mind I will add here and their results, currently using console application to do all the working as it is simple.

AB
